"""Business Digital Twin endpoints.

Routes
------

    POST   /business        create the authenticated user's business profile
    GET    /business        fetch it (with profile-completeness sidecar)
    PUT    /business        partial update — any subset of sections
    DELETE /business        remove the profile + every nested row
    GET    /business/me     alias of GET /business (intuitive)

Authentication
--------------

Every route requires a valid session (JWT cookie or
``Authorization: Bearer ***``). The owner is resolved from the JWT
subject; clients cannot pick an owner_id.
