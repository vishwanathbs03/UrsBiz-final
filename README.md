# UrsBiz — Deterministic Business Intelligence for Indian MSMEs

**One-sentence value proposition:** UrsBiz gives a micro- or small-business owner a stored business profile, a deterministic 0–100 Health Score, profile-matched government schemes with cited sources, and bank-ready PDF/CSV reports — every number reproducible from the profile.

> **Live demo:** *(public URL pending deployment — see `docs/DEPLOYMENT_HACKATHON.md` and `H7_6_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md` for the verified smoke-test path)*
> **Demo credentials (seeded workspace):** `acme.textiles@example.com` / `AcmeDemoPass1` — Acme Textiles, Tirupur, Tamil Nadu (12 employees, ₹1.8 Cr → ₹3 Cr target)
> **Architecture diagram:** [`docs/architecture-hackathon.svg`](docs/architecture-hackathon.svg)

## The Real Problem

Indian micro & small enterprises (MSMEs) navigate **multiple government portals** (msme.gov.in, nsic.co.in, kvib.gov.in, etc.) to find applicable subsidies, **manually re-type spreadsheets** for every CA or bank-loan visit, and **rely on intuition** for the next 3–12 months of cash flow. There is no single stored business profile that a CA, banker, or scheme portal can re-use, and no auditable trail of *why* a particular scheme was suggested.

UrsBiz addresses the workflow, not the politics of approvals. We do not predict funding success and we do not call any figure a guarantee.

---

## Who It's For

- **MSME founders** who need a single, current record of their business profile and a defensible health snapshot to share with a CA or banker.
- **Chartered Accountants** servicing MSME clients who want one-click PDF/CSV reports with every figure traceable to a stored input.
- **Hackathon judges and reviewers** who want to clone, run, and reproduce every claim in this README from the public demo workspace.

## Three Outcomes You Can Verify

Every outcome below is reproducible from the seeded demo workspace and is asserted by the verification suite (`scripts/verification/`). Numbers, not marketing language.

| # | Outcome | How to verify |
|---|---------|---------------|
| **1** | **Deterministic 0–100 Health Score** across four lenses (financial stability, operational risk, sales pipeline, compliance). Same inputs → same score, every run. | `GET /api/v1/business/scores` returns `healthScore` + 8 sub-scores for the demo workspace (see `H7_3_GROUNDED_GENERATIVE_AI_REPORT.md`). |
| **2** | **Profile-matched schemes** with match %, source authority, last-verified date, and disclaimer per match. Catalog has 14+ verified entries across MSME / NSIC / TUF / ZED. | `GET /api/v1/business/schemes` returns the on-disk catalog matches. The catalog itself lives in versioned YAML/JSON, loaded into a knowledge base at startup. |
| **3** | **3m / 6m / 12m scenario horizons** for forward-looking estimates, each with confidence and a `no guarantee` label, plus **1-click PDF + CSV reports** formatted for bank-loan applications. | `GET /api/v1/analytics/forecast` returns the horizons; the Reports UI exports PDF (ReportLab) and CSV with the health snapshot, scheme matches, and scenarios. |

We use **"Profile match"**, never "You are eligible" / "Approved" / "Guaranteed" / "You will receive funding" — see [`docs/HACKATHON_VISION.md`](docs/HACKATHON_VISION.md).

## AI Trust Architecture

> Full diagram: [`docs/architecture-hackathon.svg`](docs/architecture-hackathon.svg)

The AI layer has two clearly separated parts. The trust boundary is a hard rule in the codebase, not just a UI label.

| Layer | What it does | Where to look |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Deterministic engines** | Compute Health Score, scheme profile-match %, and scenario horizons from the stored business profile. Pure rule-driven. Same inputs always produce the same outputs. | `backend/app/services/business_service.py`, scheme engine under `backend/app/services/`. |
| **Grounded generative synthesis** | An *optional* OpenAI-compatible LLM rephrases the deterministic evidence bundle (scores + schemes + horizon) into natural-language answers. If no API key is set, a safe placeholder provider is used. | `backend/app/services/ai/providers/` (`base.py`, `factory.py`, `openai_compatible.py`, `prompt_builder.py`, `context_builder.py`). |

What is **explicitly not** in the architecture:

- ❌ **Vector store / embeddings / Hybrid RAG.** The repo ships without a vector layer. Retrieval is from the deterministic engine outputs, not the open web.
- ❌ **AES-256 encryption at rest.** Auth uses JWT HS256 signed tokens delivered via the `atlas_access_token` HTTPOnly cookie. There is no envelope-encryption layer in this codebase.
- ❌ **Sub-50ms API latency.** No benchmark exists. Local measured latency on the smoke-test machine is recorded in [`H7_6_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md`](H7_6_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md) — do not treat it as a global SLO.
- ❌ **"100% test pass rate across N sprints"** as a public guarantee. The verification suite (`scripts/verification/`) executes a defined set of checks; individual verifier reports record what passed.

### Trust labels in the UI

Every value the user sees is tagged with one of:

- `rule-engine` — output of a deterministic engine, fully reproducible
- `scenario estimate` — horizon from the scenario engine, with horizon + confidence
- `retrieved` — pulled from the on-disk scheme catalog with cited source
- `generated` — natural-language text from the LLM, grounded in the evidence bundle

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Python | 3.11 or 3.12 |
| Node.js | 18.x or 20.x LTS |
| Git | Any |

PostgreSQL is optional — SQLite is the zero-config dev default.

### One-time setup

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> ursbiz
cd ursbiz

# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### Run the stack (native)

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend on :8001
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# Terminal 2 — frontend on :3000
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000**.

### Run the production-mode smoke test (seeded workspace)

```bash
# Use the prebuilt ursbiz_prod.db so you get the Acme Textiles demo
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./ursbiz_prod.db \
  uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

Login at `/login` with the demo credentials above. Health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health/live    # 200 always
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health/ready   # 200 only if DB + knowledge + AI + migrations are green
```

See [`docs/DEPLOYMENT_HACKATHON.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT_HACKATHON.md) for the container path (Docker Compose: nginx + backend + frontend + prometheus + grafana) and security/observability notes.

---

## Verification Commands

Run the deterministic verifiers to confirm the claims above:

```bash
# Auth + business persistence (H7.1)
python backend/tests/test_h7_1_business_persistence.py

# Grounded generative AI + safe-placeholder fallback (H7.3)
python backend/tests/test_h7_3_grounded_generative_ai.py

# Existing suite
pytest backend/tests/ -v
```

Older verifier scripts under `scripts/verification/` exercise specific H5–H6 contracts (assistant default consultant, history, brand trust, credibility, deployment) — they print PASS/FAIL per check and are safe to re-run.

---

## Demo Screenshots

> Drop real screenshots into `docs/screenshots/` and reference them here. Captures should be of the running demo workspace (Acme Textiles, Tirupur), not mockups — see `HACKATHON_VISION.md` for the screens that matter most:

- Landing page (`/`)
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`) — health snapshot
- Schemes (`/schemes`) — profile-matched cards with match % + disclaimer
- Analytics (`/analytics`) — 3m / 6m / 12m horizons with confidence labels
- Advisor (`/advisor`) — grounded reply with trust labels
- Reports (`/reports`) — exported PDF

---

## Known Limitations

Read this section before quoting the marketing site.

1. **No embeddings, no vector store.** The AI layer is rule engines + an optional LLM rephraser. Any "vector search over official gazettes" claim is wrong and was removed from the marketing copy in P7.
2. **No AES-256 at rest.** Auth uses JWT HS256 with HTTPOnly cookies. Database-at-rest encryption depends on the deployment platform (Postgres volume encryption, disk encryption, etc.) — UrsBiz does not provide it.
3. **No sub-50ms latency SLO.** Measured latency on dev hardware is recorded in `H7_6_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md`; do not treat it as a global SLA.
4. **Scheme catalog is 14+ entries**, not 25+. The catalog is on-disk, versioned YAML/JSON, and grows under `docs/scheme-catalog/` as entries are verified.
5. **No autonomous background scheduler.** "Daily briefings" are produced on demand by hitting the AI endpoint; no cron or background worker ships in this codebase.
6. **Single-process demo DB.** `backend/ursbiz_prod.db` is SQLite and is for the hackathon demo. For multi-user / production traffic, switch `DATABASE_URL` to PostgreSQL.
7. **No national-scale impact claims.** Statistics about "63M+ MSMEs", "30% GDP contribution", or "110M+ employment impact" were removed because UrsBiz has no measurement methodology for them. Outcome numbers in the demo are demo numbers.
8. **No fabricated customer testimonials.** The landing page now publishes a "What You Can Verify" panel instead of invented quotes.
9. **Generated text is only as grounded as the evidence bundle.** If a profile is sparse, the LLM will say so or fall back to placeholder.

---

## Roadmap

- **Lender-grade audit bundle** — signed PDF with hash of input profile so a banker can re-run the same numbers.
- **Udyam portal data import** — one-click profile population from the official Udyam registration.
- **Multi-language scheme explanations** — generate grounded summaries in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali.
- **PostgreSQL migration hardening** — connection pooling, backup scripts (a `backup.sh` already exists in `deployment/scripts/`).
- **Per-tenant scheme catalog overlays** — state-specific rules on top of the central MSME catalog.
